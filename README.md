# Advent of Code

Solutions are currently in Elm and Rust.

Note that all these puzzles prioritize speed of submission (timing myself later even if I can't start exactly on time) and code is not cleaned up later.  Some solutions may not even be complete or exist at all, if they ware finished by hand in the interest of speed.
